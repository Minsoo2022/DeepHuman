### [2020/06/21] We have released THUman 2.0, a new dataset that contains 500 high-quality human scans captured by a dense DLSR rig. The quality of the scans in THUman 2.0 is much higher that the quality of THUman, so I highly recommend you to use the new dataset. Please go to [https://github.com/ytrock/THuman2.0-Dataset](https://github.com/ytrock/THuman2.0-Dataset) for more details. 


NOTE: For privacy protection, please blur the faces if the images or the models appear in any materials that will be published (such as paper, video, poster, etc.)

### Data Explanation
#### SMPL Parameters
We provide the SMPL mesh models (```smpl.obj```) as well as the the corresponding shape&pose parameters (```smpl_params.txt```)  in our dataset. 
In a SMPL parameter .txt file, three groups of coefficients are saved: shape parameters (LINE ```2```), root transformation(LINE ```4-7```) and joint rotations(LINE ```9-80```) . 
The 'shape parameters' correspond to ```betas``` in the SMPL model, while the 'joint rotations' correspond to ```thetas``` . 
The transformation matrix in 'Root Transformation' means the rotation and translation of the model around the original point of the coordinate system. 
This is different from the SMPL official code sample, in which the model is rotated around the root joint. 

Here is a piece of code showing how to use those parameters to generate a corresponding SMPL mesh: 
```python
## smpl_param_usage.py

from smpl_webuser.serialization import load_model
import numpy as np

## Read smpl parameter
with open('./data_sample/results_xxx_xxxxxxxx_xxx_1_F/xxxxx/smpl_params.txt', 'r') as fp:
    lines = fp.readlines()
    lines = [l[:-2] for l in lines]     # remove '\r\n'
    
    betas_data = filter(lambda s: len(s)!=0, lines[1].split(' '))
    betas = np.array([float(b) for b in betas_data])
    
    root_mat_data = lines[3].split(' ') + lines[4].split(' ') +\
                    lines[5].split(' ') + lines[6].split(' ')
    root_mat_data = filter(lambda s: len(s)!=0, root_mat_data)
    root_mat = np.reshape(np.array([float(m) for m in root_mat_data]), (4, 4))
    root_rot = root_mat[:3, :3]
    root_trans = root_mat[:3, 3]

    theta_data = lines[8:80]
    theta = np.array([float(t) for t in theta_data])

## Load SMPL model (here we load the male model)
## Make sure path is correct
m = load_model( './smpl_webuser/basicModel_f_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl' )

## Apply shape & pose parameters
m.pose[:] = theta
m.betas[:] = betas

## Apply root transformation
verts = m.r
verts = np.matmul(verts, root_rot.transpose()) + np.reshape(root_trans, (1, -1))

```
Note that the generated SMPL mesh would be slightly different from the one we provided (see the figure below). 
This is because in the DoubleFusion capture system, the shape parameters are gradually optimized, and after each iteration of optimization, we add the delta translations to the previous SMPL vertices instead of recalculating the vertex positions. 
Consequently, rounding error accumulates as more and more frames are processed.

#### Camera Parameters
We provide the camera extrinsic matrix (world-to-camera transformation) in ```cam.txt```. The other camera parameters are list below:
```python
# color intrinsic
c_fx = 1063.8987
c_fy = 1063.6822
c_cx = 954.1103
c_cy = 553.2578

# depth intrinsic
d_fx = 365.4020
d_fy = 365.6674
d_cx = 252.4944
d_cy = 207.7411

# depth-to-color transformation
d2c = np.array([
 [ 9.99968867e-01, -6.80652917e-03, -9.22235761e-03, -5.44798585e-02], 
 [ 6.69376504e-03,  9.99922175e-01, -1.15625133e-02, -3.41685168e-04], 
 [ 9.27761963e-03,  1.14376287e-02,  9.99882174e-01, -2.50539462e-03], 
 [ 0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  1.00000000e+00], 
    ])
```

For a point on the mesh/SMPL model, it can be projected onto the corresponding depth/color image as :
```python
# project to depth image
v_ = np.array([v[0], v[1], v[2], 1.0]).reshape([4, 1])
v_ = np.matmul(w2d, v_).reshape([4])
x = v_[0] / v_[2] * d_fx + d_cx
y = v_[1] / v_[2] * d_fy + d_cy
x = int(round(np.clip(x, 0, dpt.shape[1]-1)))
y = int(round(np.clip(y, 0, dpt.shape[0]-1)))
dpt[y, x] = np.array([255, 255, 255])

# project to color image
v_ = np.matmul(d2c, v_.reshape([4, 1])).reshape([4])
x = v_[0] / v_[2] * c_fx + c_cx
y = v_[1] / v_[2] * c_fy + c_cy
x = int(round(np.clip(x, 0, clr.shape[1]-1)))
y = int(round(np.clip(y, 0, clr.shape[0]-1)))
clr[y, x] = np.array([255, 255, 255])
```
